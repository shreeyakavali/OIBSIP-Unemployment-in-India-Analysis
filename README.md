# OIBSIP-Unemployment-in-India-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of unemployment trends in India. The project aims to explore the various factors affecting unemployment, identify patterns, and provide insights through visualizations and statistical analysis. The dataset used includes historical data on unemployment rates across different states, age groups, genders, and industries.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the unemployment situation in India, uncover the underlying causes, and offer actionable insights. The analysis covers data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning models to predict unemployment trends.

Features
Data Collection: Gathering unemployment data from reliable sources such as government databases, World Bank, and other public datasets.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, seasonal patterns, and geographical disparities using plots and graphs.
Statistical Analysis: Identifying correlations between unemployment and other economic indicators like GDP, inflation, and education levels.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing models to predict future unemployment rates and identify key influencing factors.
Geospatial Analysis: Mapping unemployment rates to visualize regional disparities.
